# InfectionSpreadingOnNetworks

The Mathematica-Notebook contained within this repository was created while working on the project mentioned below and used to present the results of my work.

The topic of the Project was Infection spreading on a Network, specified by the points:
-	Distributed connectivity of nodes and SIR model 
-	Visualization of the one-wave spreading dynamic
-	super spreader as super connected nodes

As the notebook was used for presentation purposes it is not intended to be self-explanatory, however most of the code is commented.
