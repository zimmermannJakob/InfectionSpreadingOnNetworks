# InfectionSpreadingOnNetworks

## How to view the content
The ".nb" file is a Mathematica-Notebook. If you are unable to open such files, you can still view the content through the ".pdf" file. Note that animations and such are static images when viewing the content through the pdf.

## Purpose
The Mathematica Notebook contained within this repository was created while working on the project mentioned below and used to present the results of my work.

The topic of the Project was Infection spreading on a Network, specified by the points:
-	Distributed connectivity of nodes and SIR model 
-	Visualization of the one-wave spreading dynamic
-	super spreader as super connected nodes

As the notebook was created for presentation purposes, it is not intended to be self-explanatory, however, most of the code is commented.
